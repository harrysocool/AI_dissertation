\section{Object Proposal Methods}
In order to locate the object (in this case the ear), classic approaches over the past decade have been scanning the whole image by sliding a window which is computational intensive and consequently consuming a lot of times. Therefore, recently this object proposal approach has become the state-of-art method for object detection in computer vision. It dramatically reducing the amount of candidate bounding boxes from tens to hundreds of thousands of locations per image into hundreds of it. Moreover, it is generalized for all object categories, unlike the classic method which is necessarily difficult to decide features for every object category.
